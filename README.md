## Description

### FourthDay
We studied generics



### FifthDay
We did a CLI using Inquirer library. When the CLI starts it asks to the user to use the first option, download movies and login, before use any other option. After logged, the user is able to rate a movie, see the movies rate average, add a movie to his list, change user or exit it. 

Option - Rate Movie - the user has to choose the movie he wants to rate by its id. After that, he will be asked to give the rate between 0 to 5.
Option - Show movies rate average - this one will show all movies that he had rated, with the movie name and its average.
Option - Add movie to your list - when press this option, it will first request the movie id that the user wants to add to his list, it can be how many movies he wishes, as long as it follows the example(1, 2, 3) by passing each id separated by a comma.
Option - Change user - it will show this message after pressed this option.. "User logged out... to login again, press 1". So just press 1 in order to download the movies and login again, then you can login again by selecting from any other user option again.
Option - Exit - it exits the app.

We also started to see more about decorators in Typescript.
