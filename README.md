## Description
At the first back-end week of the course, we have learned and improved a lot already. This is a summary of what we did each day.<br>

### FirstDay
Started by learn more about the Typescript syntax with a lot of examples, how to use it, and how to manipulate array data using Javascript methods.<br>
	
### SecondDay
Started working with objects, functions, strings. Also, we started building and setting the Nodejs project.<br>

### ThirdDay
Learned more about classes, how to write asynchronous code(async/await), also started to use the database [Marvel Cinematic Universe API](https://mcuapi.herokuapp.com/docs/#/Movies/get_api_v1_movies) to help with our project.<br>

### FourthDay
The main subject of this day was Generics, a Typescript tool, kind of abstract and hard at the beginning, but after many great examples it became clea. To finish the day we started learning about how to use Inquirer, a Node.js library for creating interactive CLI prompts.  <br>

### FifthDay
We did a CLI using Inquirer library.
#### About the CLI:
When the CLI starts it asks the user to use the first option, download movies and login, before use any other option. The user id must be a valid one! After logged, the user is able to rate a movie, see the movies rate average, add a movie to his list, change user or exit it. <br>

Option - Rate Movie - the user has to choose the movie he wants to rate by its id. After that, he will be asked to give the rate between 1 to 5.
<br>
Option - Show movies rate average - this one will show all movies that he had rated, with the movie name and its average.
<br>
Option - Add movie to your list - when press this option, it will first request the movie id that the user wants to add to his list, it can be how many movies he wishes, as long as it follows the example(1, 2, 3) by passing each id separated by a comma.
<br>
Option - Change user - it will show this message after pressed this option.. "User logged out... to login again, press 1". So just press 1 in order to download the movies and login again, then you can login again by selecting from any other user option again.
Option - Exit - it exits the app.
<br>
At the end of the class we had a short introduction about decorators in Typescript, next week we will delve deeper into this subject. <br>
