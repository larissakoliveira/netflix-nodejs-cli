## Description
At the first back-end week of the course, we have learned and improved a lot already. This is a summary of what we did each day.<br>

### FirstDay
Started by learn more about the Typescript syntax with a lot of examples, how to use it, and how to manipulate array data using Javascript methods.<br>
	
### SecondDay
Started working with objects, functions, strings. Also, we started building and setting the Nodejs project.<br>

### ThirdDay
Learned more about classes, how to write asynchronous code(async/await), also started to use the database [Marvel Cinematic Universe API](https://mcuapi.herokuapp.com/docs/#/Movies/get_api_v1_movies) to help with our project.<br>

### FourthDay
The main subject of this day was Generics, a Typescript tool, kind of abstract and hard at the beginning, but after many great examples it became clea. To finish the day we started learning about how to use Inquirer, a Node.js library for creating interactive CLI prompts.  <br>

### FifthDay
We did a CLI using Inquirer library.
#### About the CLI:
When the CLI starts it asks the user to use the first option, download movies and login, before use any other option. The user id MUST be a valid one! The user MUST be login to be able to rate a movie, see the movies rate average, add a movie to his list, change user or exit it, otherwise an error will be thrown. <br><br>
